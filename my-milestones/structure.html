  <h1>Basic Structure of HTML</h1>
  <p>
    In this page, I want to demonstrate the basic structure of an HTML doc in VS Code.

  <h2>This is what a header looks like in Chrome.</h2>
  <p>
    This is what a few paragraphs of text look like in Chrome. To view the code, one can right click or control click
    this page and go to View Page Source or Inspect to see how the code for this page is structured. For all other pages on this website, this
    will be a helpful tip, as what you see on this wensite is only the byproduct of written code.
